# CRM-Analytics


**What are CRM Analytics?**

CRM analytics are data that demonstrate your company’s sales and customer service performance. CRM analytics also presents customer data that you can use to inform smarter business decisions. Typically, you’ll use CRM software to obtain CRM analytics and automate all your data collection and report generation.

**Benefits of CRM Analysis**

The primary benefit of CRM analysis is that you can use it to inform your sales, customer service and marketing processes. You can use your CRM analytics to improve your methods via:

1. **Customer service evaluations.** CRM analytics fill you in on your customer service team’s performance. If you see figures that your team could improve, implement practices that push your team toward these goals.
2. **Accurate customer data.** Whether you’re using your customer data for demographic marketing or email marketing, you need to know whether you’re reaching the right person. CRM analysis ensures you’re doing just that.
3. **Thorough customer analytics.** How much does your customer usually spend per quarter with you? Are they buying the same products time and time again, or does it vary? With CRM analytics, you’ll get firm answers to these questions, and you can use what you learn to refine your marketing strategies.
4. **Efficient lead generation.** Your CRM analysis can tell you which of your marketing efforts most strongly correlate to purchases. If you see one approach correlating strongly to purchases but have only targeted a sliver of your customers with that approach, try that method more – your sales might increase.
